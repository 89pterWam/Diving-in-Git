This small notes is designed to help any beginner in linux who happened to mistakenly uninstall python3 in his/her Ubuntu 22.04LTS

Here are the following output criteria you will see on your screen once you have performed this mistake:

# Your dashbaord will be lost 
# Your desktop will be uninstall and become blank
# The top bar of your screen which display settingd and time will be gone
# Probably, you may be able to see your wallpaper
Don't panic!! just know that half of Ubuntu is built upon python package.
Look for safe means on how to uninstall unwanted dependecies on your Ubuntu.

Here are the recoverying steps you need to take: 
#1. Type Ctrl + Alt + F5 to get into the shell 
#2. Restore the dpkg by typing the following command: 
	sudo dpkg ---configure -a
Because the abrupt uninstallation of the python 3 interrupted the dkpg package 

#3. Re-install your python3 by typing : sudo apt-get install python3-all 
#4. Re-install your gnome-terminal : sudo apt-get install gnome-terminal
#5. Re-install your ubuntu desktop : sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop 

Now wait for your computer to restore itself!!
In case, your issue does not meet any of the above criteria, sorry that this note did note help you but try to find the appropriate solution
somewhere else. 
		Thank you .
